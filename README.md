# Sign-Language-Detection
A project leverging AI for sign language detection to help the specially abled.
This project focuses on developing a Sign Language Recognition system capable of interpreting hand gestures representing numbers (0-9) and alphabets (A-Z).
By leveraging machine learning models and a robust dataset of hand gestures, the system predicts the intended character with high accuracy.
The models used for this project include a pre-trained logistic regression model and a scaler for feature normalization.
Streamlit is employed for the user interface, enabling a seamless interactionexperience, while voice interaction functionality vocalizes the
predicted character, further enhancing accessibility.

All the details are mentioned in the project report present in the repository.
